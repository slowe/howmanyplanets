# How many planets are there in the Solar System?

Lots of people know that Pluto used to be a planet. Some people are very annoyed about the past tense of that sentence and would like it to go back to being a "planet" rather than a "dwarf planet".

Perhaps surprisingly, Pluto isn't the first object to have once been a planet and then to be reclassified. Take Ceres. It was found in 1801 and was a planet for around 45 years before being reclassified as an asteroid. In 2006 Ceres was reclassified again as a *dwarf planet*. It isn't just Ceres though. Many objects were classified as planets until new objects were found that forced us to reconsider the definition. 2006 was far from the first time the term *planet* has been reconsidered. It is unlikely to be the last time either.
